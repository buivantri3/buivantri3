Here is an example of a simplified Google Cloud Platform (GCP) landing zone using Terraform, focusing on core components like organization, folders, projects, and a basic network structure. This example provides a starting point and would typically be expanded with more detailed configurations for IAM, security, logging, and specific application infrastructure.

To use this example:
Initialize Terraform: terraform init
Plan changes: terraform plan
Apply changes: terraform apply
This structure allows for modularity and reusability, enabling you to build a robust and scalable GCP landing zone. Remember to replace placeholder values with your actual organization, billing, and project details.
